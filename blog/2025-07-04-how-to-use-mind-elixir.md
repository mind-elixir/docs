In our information-rich era, we're constantly dealing with vast amounts of complex data and ideas. Traditional linear note-taking often fails to capture the dynamic nature and interconnections of our thoughts, while **mind maps** serve as an intuitive note-taking tool that helps us better organize ideas, structure knowledge, and spark creativityâ€”all while being more user-friendly than whiteboards or drawing software.

Whether you're building knowledge management platforms, educational websites, or collaboration tools, integrating mind mapping functionality can significantly enhance user experience, making complex information display and interaction more intuitive and efficient.

If you want to add mind mapping capabilities to your web projects, [Mind Elixir](https://github.com/SSShooter/mind-elixir-core) makes it possible to **integrate professional-grade mind mapping with just a few lines of code**. For instance, in a **personal blog**, you can use mind maps to visualize article knowledge structures or create interactive study notesâ€”features that not only make content more engaging but also significantly boost your blog's professional appeal.

Let's dive into how you can quickly integrate Mind Elixir into your projects! ðŸ¤—

## Super Simple Integration

Install the dependency:

```bash
npm i mind-elixir -S
```

Import Mind Elixir:

```javascript
import MindElixir from "mind-elixir";
import "mind-elixir/style"; // Versions 5.0+ require explicit style import
```

Alternatively, you can include it directly via `script` tag:

```html
<script type="module" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mind-elixir/dist/MindElixir.js"></script>
```

Before initialization, we need to style your target mount element. Specifically, you need to **give it explicit width and height dimensions**, paying special attention to height. Any frontend developer who's wrestled with CSS knows that 100% height can be tricky to handle. Let's use a 500px tall div as an example.

```html
<div id="map"></div>
<style>
	#map {
		height: 500px;
		width: 100%;
	}
</style>
```

Next comes the actual initialization. If you don't need other initialization options, just pass in the mount element!

```javascript
import MindElixir from "mind-elixir";
import "mind-elixir/style";

let options = {
	el: "#map", // or HTMLDivElement
};

let mei = new MindElixir(options);
const data = MindElixir.new("new topic");
mei.init(data);
```

That's itâ€”you've completed the most basic integration!

## Event Listening

Once you've integrated mind mapping into your project, the most common requirement is event listening. You'll need to monitor various node operations and respond to user actions. For example, when a user creates a new node, you'll want to save it promptly.

Mind Elixir uses a `bus` to dispatch eventsâ€”this term comes from the "event bus" concept, where all events are dispatched through this central "bus." Usage is similar to the browser's `addEventListener`; as long as you have access to the `bus`, you can listen for events anywhere.

As of the latest Mind Elixir 5.0, the following events are available:

```ts
type EventMap = {
	operation: (info: Operation) => void;
	selectNode: (nodeObj: NodeObj, e?: MouseEvent) => void;
	selectNewNode: (nodeObj: NodeObj) => void;
	selectNodes: (nodeObj: NodeObj[]) => void;
	unselectNodes: (nodeObj: NodeObj[]) => void;
	expandNode: (nodeObj: NodeObj) => void;
	linkDiv: () => void;
	scale: (scale: number) => void;
	move: (data: { dx: number; dy: number }) => void;
	updateArrowDelta: (arrow: Arrow) => void;
	showContextMenu: (e: MouseEvent) => void;
};
```

Most node operation events are grouped under the `operation` event. Talk is cheapâ€”add this to your project and try manipulating some nodes to see how it works:

```ts
mei.bus.addListener("operation", (operation) => {
	console.log(operation);
});
```

Sometimes event listening isn't enough. If you need to ensure data is inserted into the database before displaying it, you'll need **operation interception**. Add a `before` option to your `options`â€”this is an object where keys are the operations you want to intercept. If you need to intercept the `addChild` operation, you can write:

```ts
let mei = new MindElixir({
	// ...
	before: {
		async addChild(el, obj) {
			try {
				await saveToDatabase(obj);
				return true;
			} catch (error) {
				console.error("Error adding child:", error);
				return false;
			}
		},
	},
});
```

This way, the child node will only be added after `saveToDatabase()` runs successfully; if it fails, the insertion operation will be cancelled.

## Mind Map Redrawing

Besides using Mind Elixir core's default behavior to update mind maps, you can also redraw mind maps by directly updating node data.

The complete node data structure is as follows:

```ts
export interface NodeObj {
	topic: string;
	id: Uid;
	style?: {
		fontSize?: string;
		color?: string;
		background?: string;
		fontWeight?: string;
	};
	children?: NodeObj[];
	tags?: string[];
	icons?: string[];
	hyperLink?: string;
	expanded?: boolean;
	direction?: Left | Right;
	image?: {
		url: string;
		width: number;
		height: number;
		fit?: "fill" | "contain" | "cover";
	};
	branchColor?: string;
	dangerouslySetInnerHTML?: string;
	note?: string;
}
```

By modifying node data, you can insert **images, tags, hyperlinks, and other** elements into nodes. For example, you can read the current mind map data from the Mind Elixir instance's `nodeData`, modify it, and then call the `refresh` method to redraw the mind map.

```ts
const data = mind.nodeData;
console.log(data);
data.topic = data.topic + "new Data";
mind.refresh();
```

But what if you want to update the entire mind map with completely new data? That's possible too! Pass data that conforms to the Mind Elixir format to the `refresh` method, and you can instantly update the entire map.

```ts
import data from "https://esm.sh/mind-elixir/dist/example.js";
mind.refresh(data);
```

## Freedom to Redesign

Mind Elixir gives you the freedom to completely redesign your mind maps.

First, you can easily adjust the overall style of your mind map through `theme` and `cssVar`. The core comes with two built-in themes: `MindElixir.DARK_THEME` and `MindElixir.THEME`. If you need a custom theme, you can create an object following the theme format and pass it to Mind Elixir.

Here's a complete Mind Elixir theme and how to use it:

```ts
const PROFESSIONAL_THEME = {
	name: "Professional",
	type: "light",
	palette: ["#2c2c2c", "#404040", "#555555", "#6a6a6a", "#7f7f7f", "#949494", "#a9a9a9"],
	cssVar: {
		"--node-gap-x": "32px",
		"--node-gap-y": "12px",
		"--main-gap-x": "68px",
		"--main-gap-y": "48px",
		"--root-radius": "8px",
		"--main-radius": "6px",
		"--root-color": "#ffffff",
		"--root-bgcolor": "#1a1a1a",
		"--root-border-color": "#333333",
		"--main-color": "#2c2c2c",
		"--main-bgcolor": "#ffffff",
		"--topic-padding": "4px",
		"--color": "#4a4a4a",
		"--bgcolor": "#fafafa",
		"--selected": "#666666",
		"--panel-color": "#2c2c2c",
		"--panel-bgcolor": "#ffffff",
		"--panel-border-color": "#e0e0e0",
	},
};

let mind = new MindElixir({
	el: "#map",
	theme: PROFESSIONAL_THEME,
});
```

Note that `data` itself can also contain a `theme`, which will override the `theme` in `options`. This ensures each mind map can have its own independent theme. If you need a fixed theme, remember to set the `data`'s `theme` to `undefined` during initialization.

P.S. If you want to modify the theme after initialization, you can use the `changeTheme` method.

The commonly used `main-gap` in `cssVar` can adjust the spacing between main nodes:

![Mind Elixir main-gap](https://img.ssshooter.com/img/how-to-use-mind-elixir/main-gap.jpg)

The `node-gap` can adjust the internal spacing of nodes:

![Mind Elixir node-gap](https://img.ssshooter.com/img/how-to-use-mind-elixir/node-gap.png)

For other parameters that can't be adjusted through CSS variables, you can fine-tune them directly through CSS overrides.

Going deeper, you can adjust connection line styles through `generateMainBranch` and `generateSubBranch`. (See the CodePen link below for examples)

After writing appropriate `generateMainBranch` and `generateSubBranch` functions, if you find the expand/collapse button positions are off, you can fine-tune them with CSS. The default styles are:

```less
// Expand/collapse button styles for main nodes (direct children of root)
me-main > me-wrapper > me-parent > me-epd {
	top: 50%;
	transform: translateY(-50%);
}
// Expand/collapse button styles for other child nodes
me-epd {
	top: 100%;
	transform: translateY(-50%);
}
// Specific adjustments for left-side expand/collapse buttons
.lhs {
	& > me-wrapper > me-parent > me-epd {
		left: -10px;
	}
	me-epd {
		left: 5px;
	}
}
// Specific adjustments for right-side expand/collapse buttons
.rhs {
	& > me-wrapper > me-parent > me-epd {
		right: -10px;
	}
	me-epd {
		right: 5px;
	}
}
```

## Node Styling

If you have customization needs for individual nodes beyond the overall style, nodes themselves can have `style` settings:

```ts
//...
{
  fontSize?: string
  color?: string
  background?: string
  fontWeight?: string
}
// ...
```

If you have **very strong** customization needs for nodes and feel these `style` configurations aren't nearly enough, no problemâ€”we've got you covered!

You can get even more creative with `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`, for example:

```ts
const data = {
	nodeData: {
		id: "me-root",
		topic: "Mind Elixir",
		tags: ["Mind Map Core"],
		children: [
			{
				topic: "Customized Div",
				id: "c00a2264f4532615",
				children: [
					{
						topic: "",
						id: "c00a2264f4532614",
						dangerouslySetInnerHTML:
							'<div><style>.title{font-size:50px}</style><div class="title">Title</div><div style="color: red; font-size: 20px;">Hello world</div></div>',
					},
				],
			},
		],
	},
};
```

## Exporting Images

Thanks to [modern-screenshot](https://github.com/qq15725/modern-screenshot), which cleverly converts divs to images using SVG while preserving everything intact. Basically, as long as you haven't done anything too crazy with `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` (like embedding videos), you can export images normally. `@ssshooter/modern-screenshot` adds an extra `padding` option to adjust screenshot margins.

```ts
import { domToPng } from "@ssshooter/modern-screenshot";

const download = async () => {
	const dataUrl = await domToPng(mind.nodes, {
		onCloneNode: (node) => {
			const n = node as HTMLDivElement;
			n.style.position = "";
			n.style.top = "";
			n.style.left = "";
			n.style.bottom = "";
			n.style.right = "";
		},
		padding: 300,
		quality: 1,
	});
	const link = document.createElement("a");
	link.download = "screenshot.png";
	link.href = dataUrl;
	link.click();
};
```

You can use [modern-screenshot](https://github.com/qq15725/modern-screenshot) directly or the recently released [snapdom](https://github.com/zumerlab/snapdom). If you encounter incomplete screenshots (mainly incomplete summaries and connection lines), you can adjust `--map-padding` in `cssVar`.

```ts
import { snapdom } from "@zumer/snapdom";

const dl2 = async () => {
	const result = await snapdom(mind.nodes);
	await result.download({ format: "jpg", filename: "my-capture" });
};
```

![Mind Elixir map-padding](https://img.ssshooter.com/img/how-to-use-mind-elixir/map-padding.jpg)

If you still get partial screenshots, it might be due to scale not being equal to 1. Try **setting scale to 1** before taking the screenshot, then restore the original size afterward.

## Using with Server-Side Rendering Frameworks

When using Mind Elixir in server-side rendering frameworks like Next.js, you'll often encounter issues like `window is not defined`. This is because Mind Elixir heavily relies on various DOM operations and **cannot work properly in SSR environments**.

To solve this problem, you can use `useEffect` to load Mind Elixir during client-side rendering. Here's a simple example:

```tsx
"use client";
import { useEffect } from "react";
import { mindMapExample } from "./mapExample";

export const MindMap = ({ className }: { className: string }) => {
	useEffect(() => {
		import("mind-elixir").then((MindElixir) => {
			const theme = MindElixir.default.DARK_THEME;
			theme.cssVar["--bgcolor"] = "rgba(0,0,0,0)";
			const mei = new MindElixir.default({
				el: "#map",
				direction: 2,
				theme,
			});
			mei.init({
				nodeData: mindMapExample,
			});
			mei.toCenter();
			window.addEventListener("resize", () => {
				mei.toCenter();
			});
		});
	}, []);
	return (
		<div id="wrapper" className={className}>
			<div
				id="map"
				className="pointer-events-none h-[50vh] w-screen"
				onScroll={(e) => e.preventDefault()}
			></div>
		</div>
	);
};
```

## Other Mind Elixir Options

Mind Elixir has many other configurable options:

```ts
interface Options {
	// ...
	direction?: number; // Node layout direction: 0 left, 1 right, 2 both sides
	locale?: Locale; // Language selection
	contextMenu?: boolean | ContextMenuOption; // Enable right-click menu, can add options
	toolBar?: boolean; // Enable built-in toolbar
	keypress?: boolean | KeypressOptions; // Enable shortcuts, can add custom shortcuts
	mouseSelectionButton?: 0 | 2; // Drag button, default right-click drag
	before?: Before; // Operation interception mentioned above
	newTopicName?: string; // Default value for new nodes
	allowUndo?: boolean; // Enable undo/redo
	overflowHidden?: boolean; // Whether canvas can move, useful for mind map cards
	alignment?: Alignment; // When set to 'nodes', canvas centers on mind map; when 'root', centers on root node (default)
	scaleSensitivity?: number; // Zoom sensitivity for scroll wheel and menu
	draggable?: boolean; // Whether nodes can be dragged
	editable?: boolean; // Whether editable
	// ...
}
```
